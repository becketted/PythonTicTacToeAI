# PythonTicTacToeAI
Tic Tac Toe developed within Python as part of an Artificial Intelligence module in my third year at university.  
Offers Human Vs Human, Human Vs AI and AI Vs AI (For fun...).  
This project is also my first experience using tkinter for Python GUI's.
Contains implementations of the miniMax algorithm, Newell and Simon's Tic Tac Toe Strategy, as well as the foundations for reinforcement learning.
